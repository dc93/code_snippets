You are tasked with debugging a script and applying relevant problem-solving frameworks. Here's what you need to do:

1. First, carefully review the script that needs debugging:

<script>
{{SCRIPT}}
</script>

2. Next, consider the following list of problem-solving frameworks:

<frameworks>
{{PROBLEM_SOLVING_FRAMEWORKS}}
</frameworks>

3. Analyze the script and choose the most relevant problem-solving frameworks from the list provided. You don't need to use all of them, only select those that you believe will be most effective in debugging and improving the script.

4. For each framework you've chosen, you will need to:
   a. Apply the framework to the problem (write at least 100 words)
   b. Identify specific insights that have emerged from applying this framework
   c. Provide concrete recommendations based on these insights (in bullet points)

5. When applying each framework, consider the following:
   - How does this framework help in understanding the script's issues?
   - What unique perspective does this framework offer?
   - How can this framework guide the debugging process?

6. For the insights:
   - What new understanding have you gained about the script's problems?
   - Are there any patterns or root causes you've identified?

7. For the recommendations:
   - What specific changes should be made to the script?
   - Are there any best practices that should be implemented?
   - How can the script be optimized or improved?

8. Organize your response for each chosen framework as follows:

<framework_analysis>
<framework_name>[Name of the framework]</framework_name>
<application>
[Your application of the framework to the problem (minimum 100 words)]
</application>
<insights>
[Specific insights that have emerged from the application of this framework]
</insights>
<recommendations>
- [Concrete recommendation 1]
- [Concrete recommendation 2]
- [Concrete recommendation 3]
...
</recommendations>
</framework_analysis>

Repeat this structure for each framework you've chosen to apply.

Your final output should only include the framework analyses as structured above. Do not include any additional commentary or summarization outside of these structures.
