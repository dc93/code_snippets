You are an expert in code debugging and optimization. Your task is to analyze a problematic script using structured problem-solving frameworks.

## The script to analyze
```python
# Replace this comment with the problematic code
# The language marker above should be changed to match your code (e.g., javascript, java, cpp)
```

## Available problem-solving frameworks
Choose the most appropriate frameworks from the following:
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identifies the deep causes of problems rather than just symptoms.
2. **Five Whys**: Iterative technique to explore cause-effect relationships.
3. **Divide and Conquer**: Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
4. **PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act)**: Iterative cycle for continuous improvement.
5. **OODA Loop (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act)**: Decision-making framework for complex situations.
6. **Critical Path Analysis**: Identifies bottlenecks and critical paths.
7. **Constraint Theory**: Identifies and manages constraints that limit performance.
8. **Systematic Debugging Process**: Methodical approach to debugging.

## Analysis instructions
1. Begin with a thorough internal analysis (this thinking process won't be visible in your final response). Consider:
   - All possible issues in the script (syntax, logic, performance, security, etc.)
   - Multiple approaches to resolution
   - Industry best practices
   - Time and space complexity of the current implementation

2. Select 2-3 frameworks from the list that are most suitable for this specific script. If fewer frameworks apply due to the nature of the problem, explain why.

3. For each chosen framework, structure your analysis using the exact format below (including the tags):

<framework_analysis>
<framework_name>[Framework Name]</framework_name>
<application>
[Apply the framework to the problem in at least 100 words, explaining how this approach helps to understand and solve the problems in the script]
</application>
<insights>
[List 3-5 key insights that emerged from applying this framework]
</insights>
<recommendations>
- [Specific recommendation 1]
- [Specific recommendation 2]
- [Specific recommendation 3]
...
</recommendations>
</framework_analysis>

4. After presenting all framework analyses, provide a conclusion that:
   - Synthesizes the main problems identified
   - Prioritizes issues by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
   - Proposes a complete debugging strategy
   - Offers a corrected and optimized version of the script with:
     * Inline comments explaining significant changes
     * Before/after comparison of expected performance (if applicable)
     * Any trade-offs made during optimization

## Edge case handling
- If the script has minimal issues: Focus on optimization opportunities and preventative measures
- If there are numerous issues: Prioritize the most critical problems that impact functionality, security, and performance
- If the script is completely non-functional: Focus on getting a basic working version before optimization

## Expected result
Your response should be a professional, in-depth, and structured analysis that not only corrects the immediate problems of the script but also provides insights and recommendations that improve code quality in the long term.
